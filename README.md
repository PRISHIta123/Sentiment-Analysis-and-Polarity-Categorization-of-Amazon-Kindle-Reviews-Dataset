The categories to be classified into are positive, negative and neutral reviews. Finally the obtained outputs are compared with the expected output using the f1-score computation, for each classifier and the decision boundaries created by the SVM are plotted. The kindle reviews dataset can be found at the following website: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon.
